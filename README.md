# theWorkItTimer.js
A timer to help focus on the task/s at hand. ‚è≤Ô∏è 

This was initially made around January 2020 when I was only a couple months into my JavaScript journey. I thought to upload this here as a momento of some of my first moments with Javascript, it also serves as a reminder of how far I'm progressing each day.

**Why did I make theWorkItTimer.js?**
<br/>
I needed a way to help me focus, so this was the result. It's got all the things I needed: a timer to help dedicate set time to my work, a moodboard showing the reason I'm working so hard, and a nice quote which meant something to me. üòä
