# theWorkItTimer.js
A timer to help focus on the task/s at hand. ⏲️ 

Initially made around January 2020 when I was starting out on my JavaScript journey. Have cleaned up the code a little before posting though.

I needed a way to help me focus, so one day I thought to make this, it's got all the things I needed: a timer to help dedicate set time to my work, a moodboard showing the reason I'm working so hard, and a nice quote which means something to me.
